# Petals, Parcels & Pastries
POE Part 2

## Project Overview
*Petals, Parcels & Pastries* is a boutique business offering a unique blend of floral arrangements (petals), curated gift boxes (parcels), and freshly baked sweet treats (pastries). The organization focuses on creating thoughtful and elegant gifting experiences by merging three joyful experiences into one.

The website targets individuals and organizations looking for memorable, locally sourced gifts for special occasions such as birthdays, anniversaries, weddings, corporate events, and seasonal events. Emphasis is placed on elegance, personalization, and sustainability.

The brand celebrates meaningful moments – whether surprising a loved one with fresh flowers, gifting a luxurious parcel, or indulging in handmade treats. With eco-friendly packaging and locally sourced ingredients and flowers, the website is designed for modern customers who value style, quality, and conscious living.
